31,a food chain shows how energy moves each time an animal gets eaten its energy is passed onto the animal that eats it the food chain is very important because it keeps the balance of nature if one part of the food chain disappears it can affect all the other plants and animals any threat to the food chain is a threat to the environment s biodiversit the food chain helps keep animal populations in balance however if something happens to increase or decrease one of the links in the food chain that balance is broken if one animal becomes endangered it puts all the animals above it at risk some of the threats are natural such as wildfires hurricanes tornados floods etc the food chain is endangered anywhere humans have had an effect on the natural environment a recent study shows that the overfishing of large sharks is damaging the food chain along the us atlantic coast canadian and american scientists say sharks are being killed in great numbers for their meat and fins now not enough sharks are around to eat the cownose ray the ray s population has increased and they have eaten up the shellfish to the point where it has hurt commercial fishing many of us disturb the natural environment in our own backyards it s up to us to take care of the environment and try not to disrupt the natural food chain if we don t act responsibly animals will start disappearing,Mathematics

289,the most important service of trees to man is that answer,Mathematics
290,trees are useful to man in three ways they provide him with wood and other products shade and they help to prevent droughts and floods unfortunately in many parts of the world man has not realized that the third of these services is the most important in his eagerness to make money from trees he has cut them down in large numbers only to find that without them he has lost the best friends he had and besides he is usually too careless to plant and look after new trees so the forests slowly disappear this does not only mean that man will have fewer trees the results are even more serious for where there are trees their roots break up soil allowing the rain to sink in and also bind the soil thus preventing it from being washed away easily but where there are no trees the rain falls on hard ground and flows away causing floods and carrying away the rich top soil when the top soil is gone nothing remains but worthless desert,Mathematics

489,us fish and wildlife service to classify lions in southern and eastern africa as threatened the move will place tighter restrictions on the import of lion trophies such as paws or heads while the us cannot regulate hunting in other countries the move is significant because around half of all lion hunting in africa is conducted by americans according to fws data more than 5 600 lions have been killed and imported by american hunters over the past decade under the new fws rules bringing lion parts to the us will be banned in most circumstances if the animal is from a country where lions are endangered hunters will have to show the trophies were legally obtained from countries that have a scientifically sound management program that benefits the subspecies in the wild this regulation is expected to place a far greater burden of proof upon hunters who claim that the money from lion hunting has been used to help communities in africa and the overall conservation of lions the persistent downward trend in lion numbers due to habitat loss and hunting by locals and foreign tourists suggests there has been little conservation benefit from organized hunts an international study published in september found african lion numbers have decreased by half since 1993 with a further 50 decline expected over the next 20 years for populations in west central and east africa,Mathematics

175,a lizard can run across water for a distance of several meters avoiding getting wet by rapidly hitting the water's surface with its feet the lizard will reach a speed of 20 steps per second to keep moving forward for humans we would need huge feet that we could bring up to our ears in order to create enough hitting but fortunately there is an alternative cornflour by adding enough of this common thickening agent to water and it does take a lot you can create a special mixture that doesn t behave like normal water now if the surface of the water is hit hard enough particles in the water get together for a moment to make the surface hard move quickly enough and put enough force into each step and you really can walk across the surface of this adequately thick liquid of cornflour fun though all this may sound it's still rather messy and better read about in theory than carried out in practice if you must do it then keep the water wings ready in case you start to sink and take a bath afterward,Physics
